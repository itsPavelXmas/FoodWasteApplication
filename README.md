The general objective of the application :

  Due to the fact that edible food is discarded at every point along the food chain: on farms and fishing boats, during processing and distribution, in retail stores, in restaurants and of course, at home, the purpose of the application is regarded as a main core of communication between NGOs, businesses and civilians to help manage food surplus in order to assure the distribution for those in need . We want to put an end to food waste by creating an environment where food produced is food consumed.      
  
  We believe that the users will find interesting the fact that they can share food between one another or donate it for helping the less fortunate. Also, being an application that has as target users businesses and NGOs, we will help the mass-delivery between stores or restaurants as suppliers and the mentioned  delivery assets.  
  
  We trust that by also sharing information with different kinds of users, that read our indications regarding managing food waste, food production, we will considerably reduce the times when good products are simply thrown away.  
  
  The Target Group of The Application:
Associations, Businesses, people who want to help people in need, neighbours who want to share large amounts of food between each other.
